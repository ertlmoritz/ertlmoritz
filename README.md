## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Moritz Ertl** — a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering (M.Sc.) at the Technical University of Munich with a strong interest in **artificial intelligence, computer vision, and medical technology**.  

🔹 I enjoy combining my engineering background with **data-driven approaches** to solve complex technical challenges.  
🔹 Experienced in **Python, MATLAB, Git, and Linux**, as well as embedded hardware such as **Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Edge TPU**.  
🔹 Passionate about building **reproducible, well-documented, and practical solutions** that connect research with real-world applications.  

🚀 Always curious, always learning — and excited to collaborate on innovative projects.
